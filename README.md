Paper on the Power Dynamics of Servitization of Products and Consumer Rights written in the joint course on [Digital Humanism](https://informatics.tuwien.ac.at/digital-humanism/) of [TU Wien](https://www.tuwien.at/) and [University of Vienna](https://www.univie.ac.at/).

## Abstract

The shift towards servitization of products has increasingly become a dominant business strategy in many industries. 
By conducting a thorough review of the relevant literature, this paper aims to provide insights into how the servitization of products affects the balance of power between the stakeholders involved. It tries to seek out disadvantages experienced by consumers, shed light on the role monopolies play in this context, discusses possible side effects like piracy resulting from uneven power dynamics and points out areas in need of further research.
Our findings reveal there is indeed a gap in existing research, which primarily focuses on the benefits for companies but fails to address potential disadvantages for consumers such as market control, consumer lock-in, liquidity requirements and emerging copyright issues due to the lack of ownership. We give an overview on how piracy can both be considered a symptom of a broken system as well as a bottom up approach to mitigate an uneven power distribution. Where possible, the paper tries to shed light on these negative consequences of servitization and provides insight into the complex interplay between companies and consumers in this context. Based on these findings we propose a set of policy guidelines to establish a servitization model that balances the interests of both companies and consumers.
